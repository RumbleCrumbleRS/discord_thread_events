This Discord Plugin will let you update Discord with many achievements including a Level-Up, a new collection log, a valuable drop, a completed combat achievement, a new pet, a death, and if you want to manually push it.

The benefit to other discord plugins is this has the capability to not only send the discord webhook posts to a normal text discussion thread but to a Thread/Forum itself, additionally you can specify specific tags overal as well as per achievement

First images shows how a new thread was created whenever an achievement happens
